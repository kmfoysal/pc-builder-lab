The primary limitation is PCI-Express 3.0 at x8 for graphics. Raven Ridge is an unlocked processor, that enabled multiplier we managed to get a proper 3.9 GHz out of the two cores at a voltage of 1.4 volts. One thing you do need to keep in mind is that the memory will be restricted to 2667 MHz maximum (dual-channel).",
